# utils-compare
A library for working with and comparing objects in JavaScript

A utility micro-library for working with objects in Node.js. The main purpose is to provide object comparison and difference tools. Strict equals (which is faster) and differences (which is much slower but can be used to generate a report on every single difference between two objects, including the child arrays. There is also a method to create a map from given objects, to use for setting comparison instructions.

I will update this with better instructions, example and methods overview.
